## Pymaceuticals Tumor Response Study
This is a graded project in the UC Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp which involves analyzing data from a preclinical animal study conducted by Pymaceuticals, Inc., a fictional pharmaceutical company developing anti-cancer treatments. The study evaluated the effectiveness of various drug regimens—including Capomulin, the company’s drug of interest—on squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in mice over a 45-day period.

#### As the senior data analyst, I was responsible for:

- Cleaning and preparing the dataset of 249 mice across multiple treatment regimens

- Generating key summary statistics, visualizations, and comparative analyses

- Creating tables and figures for the company’s clinical report

- Delivering a top-level summary of outcomes, with a particular focus on Capomulin’s performance relative to other treatments


#### Key Insights:
- Capomulin significantly reduced tumor volume compared to other treatments

- Time-series plots showed consistent tumor suppression in Capomulin-treated mice

- A positive correlation was observed between tumor volume and mouse weight
